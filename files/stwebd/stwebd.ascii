       that you can configure in the config file.   These  settings  are  read
       into  the  web  server  when  it  starts up.  When the server starts it
       begins listening to an assigned port for incomming connections.  When a
       connection  is  recieved  the  server  signals  a  thread to handle the
       request.  So far the only requests that can be handled are  simple  GET
       requests.  The surver simply opens the requested file and returns it to
       the requestor or an appropriate error message.

       SIGUSR1 Shutdown. Disallow new connections, wait for  existing  connec-
       tions to shutdown, terminate the server.

       SIGUSR2  Restart  the web server.  This is a soft restart, let old con-
       nections finished with the old configuration, while new connections get
       the new configuration.

       SIGHUP Restart the web server.  This is a hard restart, all active con-
       nections are closed.

              This is the main configuration file for  the  web  server.   The
              file  lets  you specify options in a OPTION VALUE format.  There
              are 4 options that you can currently list for the server.   They
              are:  PORT, CONNECTIONS, LOGPATH, and PAGEPATH.  The port is the
              active port that the server should listen on.  Connections spec-
              ifies the number of threads that you wish to have waiting around
              to service a request.  The logpath is the absolute or  realative
              path  to  the  Log  File.   The  final option specifies the root
              directory for the web pages that you want to server.
