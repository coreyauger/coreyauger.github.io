	This document is in regards to the CPSC 550 assignment 2 ( Interprocess Communication ) Web Server.
	The program is designed to parse through a configuration file that tells the system what port to listen 
	for connections on.  It also tells the system how many threads to use to service requests.  When 
	a connection is formed the program wakes a thread from our thread pool to handle the request.  When 
	the request is complete the thread goes back to sleep in the thread pool.  There are a number of 
	signals that the program handles as well.  These are explained in full detail in the document.
