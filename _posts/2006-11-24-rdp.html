  <p>Name: Recursive Descent Parser<br>
    Language: C<br>
    API: Lex / Yacc<br>
    Platform: Linux<br>
  </p>

  <p>This is a C project that I wrote for my Compiler class.  The idea was that we were given a simple definition
    of a fictitious language called "miniscus".  We had to take the basic rules of the language and useing lex and yacc, create
    a recursive descent parser that compiled the language.</p>

  <p>More information to come.</p>
