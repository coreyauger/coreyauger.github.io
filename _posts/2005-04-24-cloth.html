  <p>Name: Cloth Simulation<br>
    Language: C/C++<br>
    API: OpenGL<br>
    Platform: Windows<br>

  <p>Another really fun project.  This was a project that I had to do for my computer science (Animation) class.
    We implemented a mass spring model to simulate the cloth.  I then drop the cloth from above a sphere and watch
    the collision take place.  I added some texturing and a reflection in the floor to make it look a little more
    realistic.  Looks really kewl when you see it in motion though.</p>

  <p>Here is a screen shot of the project.<p>

  <p>It would be fun to make a full physic system to play with, possibly for a game engine.  I find that playing
    with physics in your graphics simulations is one of the more rewarding projects in the end.</p>
