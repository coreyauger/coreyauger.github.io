  <p>Name: Water Simulation<br>
    Language: C/C++<br>
    API: OpenGL<br>
    Platform: Windows<br>
  </p>

  <p>This was a really fun project to work on.  The main idea for the movement of the water came
    from one of my favorite sites on the net:
    <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm">The good-looking textured light-sourced bouncy fun smart and stretchy page</a>.
    Once I got the water moving correctly the next step was to get some form of texturing working on it.
    For the water colour I multi-textured the floor of the pool with a fake sky.  This is done by constantly taking the look
    vector and bending it by the <a href="http://www.ps.missouri.edu/rickspage/refract/refraction.html">refractive index of water</a>
    and noticing where this vector now intersects with the wall off the pool.

  <p>Here is a screen shot of the project.<p>

  <p>I really encourage anyone to try this type of a project, it is really very rewarding.  If anyone would like more
    information then the very little that I provided, please contact me corey(at)coreyauger.com.</p>
