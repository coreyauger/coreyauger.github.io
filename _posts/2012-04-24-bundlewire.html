    <p>We think its about time for a better way to find, gather, organize and share all of your web goodies. &nbsp;A way that lets you capture <em><strong>why</strong></em> you found certain things interesting or important and share that as well as the links themselves.</p>
    <p>We think that is missing piece out there and the reason why is just as important as the content itself.</p>
    <p>We also figured that would be a good way to let people collaborate on building bookmark sets without having to repin or retweet everything. &nbsp;All the cool stuff you and your friends find and why you are sharing it â€“ in one place.</p>
    <p>As you find things, you can also share those with friends in Facebook and Twitter and show them you love it, hate it, think its cool, scary, awesome, recommend it or want it.</p>
    <p>That's right, you are no longer confined to the "like" button!</p>
    <p>Welcome to Bundlewire<br>
      A better way to gather, organize and share your links, images and videos.<br>
      Its knowledge captured.</p>
