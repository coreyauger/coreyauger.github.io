  <p>Name: Subdivision Sand Box<br>
    Language: C/C++<br>
    API: OpenGL<br>
    Platform: Windows<br>
  </p>

  <p>This is a project that I did as an assignment for cpsc 553 (Graphics 2).  The project specification was just to
    create a grid that we could then preform uniform subdivisions.  To make it a little more interesting I created a
    scene of a sandbox.  The models were read in as (*.obj) files and positioned in the sand.  The user could then subdivide
    the sand into smoother and smoother curves.</p>

  <p>Here is a screen shot of the project.<p>
  <div align="center"><img src="/images/subdiv_sand.jpg" alt="project picture"></div>
  <p>In addition to this I allowed you to rotate the camera around the scene and zoom in and out.  You could also toggle
    the visibility of the lines that make up the wire frame mesh of the sand.</p>

  <p>This ended up being a fun project.  You could take it a little further with some texture mapping and better
    lighting.  If anyone else has done a project similar or would like to ask any questions on anything that was done, I would be
    more then happy to help out.</p>
