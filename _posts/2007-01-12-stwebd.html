  <p>Name: stwebd<br>
    Language: C<br>
    Platform: Linux/Solaris<br>
  </p>

  <p>This was a kewl assignment designed to teach us inter-process communication.  The assignment specifications are as follows:</p>

  <h2>Assignment</h2>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem:</span>
  <p>You are to write a simple threaded web server.  It reads a configuration file which contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The absolute path to the home location of the pages to be served</li>
    <li>The port to use</li>
    <li>Th maximum number of active connections allowed</li>
    <li>The location of the log file</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each connection will be a thread that remains until the connection is closed.  The only aspect of HTTP
    that you must implement is a very simple version of the "GET" command.  Other things are nice but not really
    necessary.  The web server will do the following upon the receipt of the indicated signal:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>SIGINT</b> Dump the status information to the status file</li>
    <li><b>SIGHUP</b> Restart the web server. This is a hard restart, all active connections are closed.</li>
    <li><b>SIGUSR1</b> Shutdown. Disallow new connections, wait for existing connections to shutdown, terminate the server.</li>
    <li><b>SIGUSR2</b> Restart the web server.  This is a soft restart, let old connections finish with the old configuration, while new connections get the new configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You must also provide a man page for this program.  It must be formatted as all of the UNIX man pages
    are formatted.  You may use either the nroff macros, or you may use SGML.  On-line documentation for both
    exist on Solaris machines.</p>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hand In:</span>
  <p>You must hand in a fully documented copy of your assignment.  You must demonstrate that it worked.
    You must hand in the source for your manpage as well as a good formatted copy.</p>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rules</span>
  <p>You may NOT use Java. You should use "C".  Socket calls and Signal handlers must be well indicated.
    You should realize that very little systems programming is done in languages other than something based on "C".

  <h2>My Solution</h2>
  <p>My solution used ptheads.  I first read in the configuration file and created a thread pool of waiting threads.
    For this I created a struct thats contents were the following:</p>
  <code>
    <br>
    struct thread_data{<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pthread_t td_thread;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int td_id;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int td_socket;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct sockaddr_in td_client_addr;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pthread_mutex_t *td_mutex_wait;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pthread_cond_t  *td_cond_wait;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void (*td_handler)( struct thread_data* );<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volatile sig_atomic_t td_active;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void (*td_post_handler)( struct thread_data* );<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
  </code>

  <p>This encapsulates the thread as well as a wait condition and mutex for control over it.  The function
    pointers allowed me to arbitrarily assign activities that the thread will work on.  The following function
    controls the threads to do my evil bidding ;)</p>

  <code>
    <br>
    1:void* threadManager( void* thread_args )<br>
    2:{<br>
    3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct thread_data *tdata;<br>
    4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tdata = (struct thread_data*)thread_args;<br>
    5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for( ;; )<br>
    6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
    7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if( tdata->td_post_handler )<br>
    8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*tdata->td_post_handler)( tdata );<br>
    9:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tdata->td_active = 0;<br>
    10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++threads_waiting;<br>
    11:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if( pthread_cond_wait(tdata->td_cond_wait, tdata->td_mutex_wait) )<br>
    12:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error("pthread_cond_wait failure");<br>
    13:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tdata->td_active = 1;<br>
    14:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tdata->td_socket = conn_fd;<br>
    15:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pthread_mutex_unlock( tdata->td_mutex_wait );<br>
    16:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*tdata->td_handler)( tdata );<br>
    17:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;close( tdata->td_socket );<br>
    18:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tdata->td_socket = 0;<br>
    19:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;webConfig.sc_connserv++;<br>
    20:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
    21:}<br>
    <br>
  </code>
  <p>The thread pool work on the fact that all the pthreads enter the above function and enter a wait
    state at line 11.  When the main thread receives a connection it wakes up one of the threads by signaling
    on the condition variable.  That thread will take the socket and record its active state before unlocking
    the mutext so that other threads may be signaled.  This will protect against the race condition of two threads
    grabbing the same socket.  The thread then jumps to a handler function on line 16.  This function pointer was
    initialized earlier on and is the main worker function for the thread.</p>

  <p>This thread pool concept work very well for me and I would definitely extend it to other projects that
    I am working on.  I realize that the explanation my be a little short... but I have included links to the
    entire code below and you are always free to mail me with any questions: corey(at)coreyauger.com .</p>

  <p>There was one other thing worth mentioning in this project.  It had to do with the way that the SIGUSR2
    was handled.  In this condition the server closed the listening socket and set a codition variable thus causing
    the main thread listening on it to error.  I then tested for the setting of the condition variable.  If it is set
    then I fork a new process and wait on the live threads in the old process.  This has the effect of allowing the
    old process with active threads to finish with the old config while a new process is created forcing the new config
    parse to start up.  When the old process threads have completed we allow the process to die.  The signal code for this
    is in the sighandles.c and the fork process can be seen in main.c .</p>

  <p>Once again it will be more clear to anyone interested it they download the source code.</p>
