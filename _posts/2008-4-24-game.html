  <p>Here is one of my works in progress.  I would really like to get some form of a game going that I could
    continue to work on.  What I have got so far is a way to build levels and calculate static lighting on it.
    This then gets hacked up into a BSP (binary space partition) tree.  This allows me to only render parts
    of the level that the player is looking at, plus it helps me with collisions detection.  The bsp tree here
    is similar to the one being used in games like quake.  Although it is really still in it's infancy.</p>

  <p>Here is a screen shot of the project.<p>

  <p>If anyone is interested in trying to help me get this type of a project off the ground, please let me know.  For more
    information on BSP tree's or to take a course online having to do with them see: <a href="http://www.gameinstitute.com">www.gameinstitute.com</a></p>
