  <p>Name: Radiosity<br>

  <P><B>1. Project Goal</B></P>
  <P>We plan on creating computer generated images of the best
    quality through a synthesis of Radiosity and Ray Tracing. This
    combination will allow us to simulate the diffuse, and specular
    interactions in complex environments. Because both methods are
    time consuming we will be using acceleration techniques in both.</P>
  <P>These techniques include:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI><P>Octree generation for fast spatial determination.
    </P>
    <LI><P>Using graphics hardware Z-buffer for visibility
      determination in radiosity solution.
    </P>
    <LI><P>Saving information into texture memory.
    </P>
    <LI><P>Mini-mapping hemi-cube information for form factor
      calculations.
    </P>
    <LI><P>Distributed Ray Tracing techniques to simulate imperfect
      reflections.
    </P>
  </UL>
  <HR>
  <P><B>2. Motivation</B></P>
  <P>Computer generated images typically concentrate on one portion
    of the lighting equation: either diffuse or specular lighting.
    Recently, new algorithms, new data structures and concepts have
    been researched to represent a more complete view of the lighting
    in increasingly complex environments. The radiosity approach stems
    from the want to simulate indoor environments where diffuse
    lighting is the primary mode of heat transfer. Ray tracing
    surfaced to simulate the way rays interact with reflective and
    specular surfaces. These two approaches are typically separated,
    however by combining the two one can look at both parts of the
    lighting equation. This is extremely useful in indoor environments
    with shiny reflective objects.</P>
  <HR>
  <P><B>3. Key Technical Challenges</B></P>
  <P><I>Radiosity</I>
  </P>
  <P>With regards to radiosity the key challenges lie in the speed
    and accuracy of the solution. We plan to exploit modern graphics
    hardware to aid in the visibility and form factor calculations.
    The main challenges will be with regard to the accuracy of the
    solution. We plan on having a very adaptive solution to allow us
    to experiment with different thresholds.</P>
  <P>Additional challenges for the radiosity section is going to
    come from 'tight' geometry. We would like our solution to be able
    to handle models of any shape and complexity. With a hemi-cube
    approach this will pose problems in tight corners where the
    hemi-cube protrudes into geometry, or sees right through a faces
    in the geometry. In this case we are going to have to test the
    area around the hemi-cube and do some work to not allow the
    hemi-cube to pierce the geometry.</P>
  <P><I>Ray Tracer</I>
  </P>
  <P>The Key technical challenge for the ray tracer will be the
    lighting model to use when combining the final information into a
    pixel color to display on the screen. There will be texture
    mapping details, the light map representing the diffuse and
    ambient lighting for the triangle, as well as the specular
    information gathered by the ray tracer. We plan to use
    Cook-Torrance lighting to achieve a more realistic colors and
    images.
  </P>
  <HR>
  <P><B>4. Approach</B></P>
  <P><B>4.1 Overview</B></P>
  <P><I>Radiosity</I>
  </P>
  <P>Dividing each face of our scene into light-map texel regions,
    we are going to perform a gathering type of radiosity solution.
    First by using GL to render the scene from the perspective of a
    texel into a hemi-cubed texture map, we solve the visibility
    problem. After applying a lambertian mask over the pixels and
    perspective correction we then evaluate the hemi-cube as a 1x1
    mini-map. This will be our form-factor calculation. This value
    gets stored in the light-map location that was being evaluated.
    This continues until we have converged on a solution. To further
    speed this process up we would only calculate (in between) pixels
    if they did not meet an interpolation threshold. This will allow
    for adaptive sampling at shadow boundaries. Additionally our scene
    is in an Octree format, so we will perform frustum culling and
    only pass vertices's to the renderer that the point can see. This
    should yield an acceptable upper limit on the complexity of most
    complex scenes.</P>

  <P><BR><BR><I>Ray Tracer</I>
  </P>
  <P>The geometry will be loaded into an Octree to accelerate the
    intersection routines. The ray tracer will use the typical Ray
    Tracing technique by shooting rays from the eye, through the
    screen pixels and into the scene. The Octree will provide a quick
    intersection with surfaces in the scene. Then the ray tracer will
    analyze the properties of the intersection object. Based on this
    information it will ascertain whether it's necessary to recurse to
    obtain the reflected light. This will automatically be cutoff at a
    specified recursion level. The reflection rays will be shot in
    varying ways. We will store a reflection index which indicates how
    &quot;perfect&quot; the patch reflects light. We will always shoot
    16 rays, but the angle from the perfect reflection ray to the
    actual rays shot will be determined by the index. The greater the
    angle, the less perfect of a reflection is shot. Once all of the
    specular data has been obtained at a particular intersection, it
    will be combined with the diffuse information stored from the
    radiosity solution.

  <BR>This image shows the cornel box after 3 passes. It looks very
  close to a full solution and we are quite proud of this image. The
  light on the roof really shows off the radiosity approach, as well
  as the color bleeding.

  This image shows a a typical indoor scene. The artifacts along the
  edge of the pillars show a flaw in the lightmap method where
  opengl interpolates to a black color which is on the edge of the
  lightmap's triangle. However, the tables look amazing and in
  general the scene's lighting looks very realistic.
  </P>
  <HR>
  <P><BR>( missing octree graphic )

    <BR>This is the only scene we currently have that shows off the
    ray tracing algorithm. It shows an opengl rendering of the
    axis-aligned bounding boxes that form the octree for a spider
    mesh. This really shows off the adaptive nature of an octree, as
    the space where geometry is really crowded, are subdivided even
    further and low polygon areas.
  </P>
  <P>As you can see our engine is not yet complete. We will tweaking
    the radiosity algorithm to remove the artifacts and merging the
    ray-tracing algorithm with the radiosity solution, in the next few
    days and expect to have this fully working by our demo on friday.
  </P>
  <P><B>6 Conclusion</B></P>
  <P><I>Radiosity</I>
  </P>
  <P>Implementing radiosity in hardware using OpenGL has turned out
    to be much harder than originally anticipated. OpenGL is not well
    suited to the algorithm, and much care must be taken to use it
    correctly. It does lend itself well to generating the hemicube
    from points on the triangles, however this information cannot be
    read directly from the texture memory. To solve this we had to
    render the hemicube to the screen and read the frame buffer
    memory. However this clamps all values to 0.0-1.0. This does not
    allow really bright lights to be used, and care must be taken to
    use the correct model when dealing with this.
  </P>
  <P>Once the hemicube is generated this information is combined
    into a single pixel value in the lightmap which pertains to the
    current point on the triangle. The only problem encountered in
    this was the alias problem where the middle of a lightmap pixel
    related to a point in object space that did not receive any light.
    However part of that lightmap pixel is included in the triangle's
    u-v texture mapping space. This create artifacts along edges of
    walls and and in corners. Care was then taken to correctly sample
    these edges in the lightmaps to generate the correct light at that
    position.
  </P>
  <P><B>Performance</B>
  </P>
  <P>Our program operates at an efficiency that is dependent on the
    area of the scene that requires sampling. In this manor we can
    operate somewhat independent of the triangle complexity of the
    scene. If we had time to integrate the octree into the radiosity
    solution, we could then only pass visible geometry to the hemicube
    renderer. In this manor we would more be affected by the
    additional lightmaps that needed to be sampled and not by the
    complexity of the scene.</P>
  <P>The advantage of our stratagy is that it allows you to
    adaptively choose heuristics. These include:
  </P>
  <UL>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Size of the hemicube.
    </P>
    <LI><P>Triangle Area to lightmap ratio.
    </P>
  </UL>
  <P>To further improve the performance we only sample points that
    will be in the triangle. The algorithm to determine this
    relationship can be done in 2D texture space and is thus way
    faster then the inner angle theorem in 3D. We had planned a
    further improvement but failed in the time we have left to
    implement it. This improvement would allow you to sample every N
    number of pixels on the grid in your first pass through the map.
    You then look at the bilinear difference in the samples that you
    have taken. If they are within a threshold then you take simply
    interpolate. If they are not then you sample again in between
    these points. Full details on this can be found on Hugo Elias
    <A HREF="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/radiosity/radiosity.htm">website</A>.
  </P>
  <P>Another advantage is that after every pass you can walk your
    camera around the room in real time and check for an problems thus
    far in the solution. If you are happy with the current solution
    you can save the lightmaps out to disk and begin the program on
    another pass.</P>
  <P>Edge Artifacts.</P>

  </P>
  <P>Sampling the pixel at position A yields a result that is inside
    the triangle and looking at the light. Sampling at position B
    gives us in many occasions a sample from inside the wall ( or
    totally black ). Once we interpolate the result we have an edge
    that fades to black. The solution to this is to detect the
    boundary cases and sample for point B a sample from right on the
    triangles edge.</P>
  <P>This problem should be fixed by Friday :)
  </P>
  <P><I>Ray-Tracing</I>
  </P>
  <P>Unfortunately the ray-tracing part of the system has not yet
    produced any usable results. The geometry is loaded into an
    octree, and the intersection tests for the octree have been
    perfected which yields reasonably fast times on models of medium
    size. However the light model to combine the specular and diffuse
    lighting from the radiosity has not yet been implemented to a
    usable state. We have included a picture of an OpenGL rendering of
    the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes for the octree which was created
    for a 21,000 face mesh. The mesh is not rendered to show you how
    the geometry is centered.
