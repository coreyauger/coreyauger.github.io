  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>This was an assignment in my system admin class.  Here is the notes and assignment that I handed into the instructor</p>

    Hey Cliff,<br>
    <br>
    Very kewl assignment this time.  I am really
    into this kernel mod stuff.  I decided to alter
    the assignment a little... into an evil
    assignment.  I was first going to write a module
    that stole syscalls and spyed on them, but since
    the syscall table is no longer exported in 2.6
    kernels this was not an option.  So what I have
    done instead was to write a device driver that
    once you create the device node /dev/killpid you
    can read and write to the device.  What you can do
    then is 'echo "pid" > /dev/killpid' and my module
    will use kernel functions to kill that process.
    This allows anyone with perm to write to this device
    to end any process on the system that they see fit.
    Hance the 'evil' aspect to it ... muu ha ha ha.
    <br><br>
    Anyhow I will demonstrate its use on my system.. and
    I plan on playing with this stuff a lot more.
    Perhaps I will work on a kewl module for the project
    in this class.  But like I said.. very kewl assignment.
