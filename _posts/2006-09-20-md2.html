  <p>Name: MD2 Animator<br>
    Language: C/C++<br>
    API: OpenGL<br>
    Platform: Windows<br>
  </p>

  <p>This project loads md2 (quake 2) models and allows you to loop through the animation sequences.  MD2 model format basically
    consists of a bunch of Points at different "key frames".  To animate between them I used linear interpolation between each
    of the key frames.  This was a fun little project that you could end up using to load models into your own game.  There are
    a bunch of free tools out there to work with MD2 files and the format is very well documented.</p>

  <p>Here is a screen shot of the project.<p>

  <p>A major improvement on this type of model, would be to a load model with joints and motion ranges.  This is what most games
    are doing now and it is how you get the really cool rag doll physics when you shoot up some character.</p>
