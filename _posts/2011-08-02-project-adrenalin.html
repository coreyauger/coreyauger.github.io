    <h4>Optimized for OpenGL and DirectX Games.</h4>
    <p>Adrenalin has been tuned to stream and remote play any game you have on your PC. If your PC has enough
      grunt to play and display 3D games while you watch YouTube and other video content, Adrenalin should work great!</p>

    <p>We designed Adrenalin to broadcast your sick game moves to streaming services like Justin.tv - in max quality.
      We also decided to add another twist to this. Your friends can not only watch your webcast but if you like, you
      can let them take a crack at it and share the game controls with them too! Donâ€™t worry you can boot them out
      when they start talkin' smack.</p>
